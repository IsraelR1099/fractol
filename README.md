### Viewing and modeling
In an application, we have a rectangle compose of pixels, we will call this rectangle **Viewport**. We also have some objects that make up the "scene" or "world" that we want to view, the coordinates that we use to define the scene are called **World Coordinates**. For 2D graphics the world lies in a plane. As we are not able to show a picture of the entire infinite plane we should pick some rectangular area in the plane to display in the image.
